**_What Is Scikit-Learn?_**

Scikit-learn is an open-sourced Python library and includes a variety of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. It is based on technologies and libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas and NumPy and helps simplify the coding task.

Scikit-learn features include:
1) Model selection
2) Classification (K-Nearest Neighbors inclusive)
3) Preprocessing (Min-Max Normalization inclusive)
4) Clustering (K-Means++ and K-Means inclusive)
5) Regression (Logistic and Linear Regression inclusive)

Use of Scikit-Learn

Scikit-learn allows us to define machine learning algorithms and compare them to one another, as well as offers tools to preprocess data. K-means clustering, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and any other machine learning model that we might want to develop are all included in Scikit-learn.
Scikit-learnâ€™s true strength resides in its model assessment and selection architecture, which allows us to cross-validate and perform multiple hyperparameter searches on our models. Scikit-learn also helps us choose the best model for our work.

Pros
1) Users who want to connect the algorithms to their platforms will find detailed API documentation on the scikit-learn website.
2) Many contributors, authors, and a large international online community support and update Scikit-learn.
3) It's simple to use. The library is released under the BSD license, making it available for free with only the most basic licensing and legal          constraints.
4) The scikit-learn package is extremely adaptable and useful, and it can be used for a variety of real-world tasks such as developing neuroimages, predicting consumer behavior, and so on.

Cons
1) nNot a great choice if one prefers in-depth learning.
2) Provides a simple abstraction that may tempt junior data scientists to proceed without first learning the basics.
